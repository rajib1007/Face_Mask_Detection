# Face_Mask_Detection
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this tutorial we will develop a machine learning project â€“ Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.


## Real-Time Face Mask Detector with Python

We will build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. We will train the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.


## Download the Dataset

The dataset we are working on consists of 1376 images with 690 images containing images of people wearing masks and 686 images with people without masks.
